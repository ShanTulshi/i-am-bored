# i-am-bored
A program that suggests you things to do when you are bored. Feel free to add more ideas to kill boredom.

## How to use?
Simply download the `IAmBored.py` file and double click it to run the file.

For the server, install all dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then run `export FLASK_APP=BoredServer.py && flask run` to run on localhost. See the [Flask docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/) for more information.

GET requests to the server will return a JSON with "line" and "subtitle" properties.

#### _Lets make it a less boring place together._
